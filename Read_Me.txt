Tech Clinic : 
My project provides the doctors at clinics/hospitals an easy way to store and access details of all their
patients. They can easily search for any patient through either Name, Phone number or even Symptoms!

Also it can generate reports on : Earnings collected in a specific duration, Patients whom have recently 
visited, Age group classification of recent patients (Can help identify some Lifestyle disorders/Disease 
occuring prominently in one specific age group).
